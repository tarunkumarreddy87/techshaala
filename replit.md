## Design Philosophy

The application follows modern educational platform design principles:

1. **Clarity Over Decoration**: Every element serves a functional purpose
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed based on user role and context
3. **Achievement Visibility**: Progress and accomplishments are immediately apparent
4. **Cognitive Ease**: Consistent patterns reduce mental load
5. **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation
