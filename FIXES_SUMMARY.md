# Fixes Summary

This document provides a summary of all the fixes and improvements made to resolve the reported issues and implement the requested feature.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Page TypeScript Error
**Issue**: `Module '"@shared/schema"' has no exported member 'LoginCredentials'.`
**File**: `client/src/pages/login.tsx`
**Fix**: 
- Removed the import of `LoginCredentials` from `@shared/schema`
- Defined the `LoginCredentials` type locally using `z.infer<typeof loginSchema>`
- Changed the import path for `loginSchema` to use relative path `../../shared/schema`

### 2. Student Course Detail Page TypeScript Errors
**Issue**: Type errors related to `AssignmentWithCourse` and missing `submission` property
**File**: `client/src/pages/student-course-detail.tsx`
**Fix**:
- Changed the assignment type from `Assignment[]` to `(Assignment & { submission?: SubmissionWithDetails; })[]`
- Updated the query key to use `/api/courses/:id/assignments-with-submissions` instead of `/api/courses/:id/assignments`
- Modified the assignment mapping to properly include the course information when passing to AssignmentCard

### 3. New API Endpoint for Assignments with Submissions
**File**: `server/routes.ts`
**Fix**: Added a new endpoint `/api/courses/:id/assignments-with-submissions` that:
- Requires authentication and student role
- Checks if the student is enrolled in the course
- Fetches assignments for the course
- Adds submission data for each assignment for the requesting student

### 4. Submit Assignment Page Date Formatting Error
**Issue**: `No overload matches this call` for date formatting
**File**: `client/src/pages/submit-assignment.tsx`
**Fix**: Added proper null checking for `submittedAt` before formatting the date

### 5. Teacher Assignment Submissions Page Enhancement
**File**: `client/src/pages/teacher-assignment-submissions.tsx`
**Enhancement**: Completely redesigned the submissions view to include:
- A table with columns: S.No, Student Name, Course Name, Submitted On, Status, Actions
- Status indicators with green tick for on-time submissions and red cross for late submissions
- Proper date formatting and null checking
- Improved UI with better organization of grading actions

## Features Implemented

### Enhanced Teacher Assignment Submissions View
The teacher assignment submissions page now displays a comprehensive table with:

1. **S.No**: Sequential numbering for submissions
2. **Student Name**: Student name with avatar
3. **Course Name**: Name of the course (from assignment data)
4. **Submitted On**: Date and time of submission with proper formatting
5. **Status**: Visual indicators showing:
   - Green tick with "On Time" for submissions before deadline
   - Red cross with "Late" for submissions after deadline
   - Clock icon with "Pending" for unsubmitted assignments
6. **Actions**: Buttons for grading or editing grades

## Technical Improvements

## Testing

All fixes have been tested to ensure:
- No TypeScript errors remain

## Summary

The fixes address all the reported TypeScript errors while implementing the requested feature of showing a detailed table view of student submissions with status indicators. The implementation follows the existing code patterns and maintains consistency with the rest of the application.
